    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A lady I worked with brought this in one day, and it was a hit. Now it is
      the favorite of all my dinner guests. It's great for a covered dish dinner
      too. I have made this also without the meat, and it is well received.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound dry ziti pasta</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>2 (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce</li>
      <li>6 ounces provolone cheese, sliced</li>
      <li>1.5 cups sour cream</li>
      <li>6 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and
        cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet, brown onion and ground beef over medium heat. Add
        spaghetti sauce, and simmer 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13 inch
        baking dish. Layer as follows: 1/2 of the ziti, Provolone cheese, sour
        cream, 1/2 sauce mixture, remaining ziti, mozzarella cheese and
        remaining sauce mixture. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until cheeses are melted.
