# A common 'modal' style
This one is another very common pattern on the web. The solution to this one is _simple_... but it might not be immediately obvious to you. You'll need to edit the HTML a bit to get everything where it needs to be.

### A hint
Depending on how you approach this one, you might need to revisit the `flex-shrink` property to keep a flex item from getting smashed.

### Self Check

- The blue icon is aligned to the left.
- There is equal space on either side of the icon (the gaps between the icon and the edge of the card, and the icon and the text, are the same).
- There is padding around the edge of the modal.
- The header, text, and buttons are aligned with each other.
- The header is bold and a slightly larger text-size than the text.
- The close button is vertically aligned with the header, and aligned in the top-right of the card.
