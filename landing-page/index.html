      <em>Hi, I'm Tom Cruise. As you know by now, the only criteria for me supporting a cause is that it has a name.
        That's
        why I love Let's Chat! Let's Chat! is great because I can use it to keep in touch with some of
        my old Scientology buddies when I connect with them by chance. Which is highly unlikely. In fact, it's never
        happened because none of them use this app. But if they did, I'm sure we might connect eventually.
