      Hi, I'm Tom Cruise. As you know by now, the only criteria for me
      supporting a cause is that it has a name and no redeeming qualities.
      That's why I love <em>Let's Chat!</em> <em>Let's Chat!</em> is great
      because I can use it to keep in touch with some of my old Scientology
      buddies when I connect with them by chance. Which is highly unlikely. In
      fact, it's never happened because none of them use this app. But if they
      did, I'm sure we might connect eventually.
