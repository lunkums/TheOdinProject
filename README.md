The following repository contains my submissions for assignments in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Each section below includes a list of points that I've learned while studying it's corresponding section in the curriculum. If there is a project associated with a section, a link to my submission will be included in the heading.

## HTML Foundations ([Project: Recipes](./odin-recipes))
- Google evaluates search terms in headers based on which rank of header is used (i.e. h1 more important than h2)
- Image tags should always include an "alt" attribute to improve accessibility
- Git commits should use an active voice (i.e. "Fix player collision bug" instead of "Fixed player collision bug") to match Git conventions
