Each section below includes a list of points that I've learned while studying it's corresponding section in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
## HTML Foundations (Project: Recipes)
- Google evaluates search terms in headers based on which rank of header is used (i.e. h1 more important than h2)
- Image tags should always include an "alt" attribute to improve accessibility
- Git commits should use an active voice (i.e. "Fix player collision bug" instead of "Fixed player collision bug") to match Git conventions
